				<p><i>
				We were speeding together<br>
				Down the dark avenues<br>
				But besides all the stardom<br>
				All we got was blues<br>
				</p></i>

				<p><b>
				But through all the sorrow<br>
				We were riding high<br>
				And the truth of the matter is<br>
				I never let you go, let you go<br>
				</b></p>
				<p><i>
				We were scanning the cities<br>
				Walking to greater dues<br>
				But besides all the glamour<br>
				All we got was bruised<br>
				</i>
				</p>
				<p><b>
				But through all the sorrow<br>
				We were riding high<br>
				And the truth of the matter is<br>
				I had to let you go, let you go<br>
				</b>
				</p>
				<p><i>

				You go down just like Holy Mary<br>
				Mary on a, Mary on a cross<br>
				Not just another Bloody Mary<br>
				Mary on a, Mary on a cross<br>
				</i>
				</p>
				<p><b>

				If you choose to run away with me<br>
				I will tickle you internally<br>
				And I see nothing wrong with that<br>
				</b>
				</p>
				<p><i>
			
				We were searching for reasons<br>
				To play by the rules<br>
				But we quickly found<br>
				It was just for fools<br>
				</i>
				</p>
				<p><b>
		
				And after all the sorrow<br>
				We'll be riding high<br>
				And the truth of the matter is<br>
				I'll never let you go, let you go<br>
				</b>
				</p>
				<p><i>

				You go down just like Holy Mary<br>
				Mary on a, Mary on a cross<br>
				Not just another Bloody Mary<br>
				Mary on a, Mary on a<br>
				</i>
				</p>
				<p><b>
				
				You go down just like Holy Mary<br>
				Mary on a, Mary on a cross<br>
				Your beauty never ever scared me<br>
				Mary on a, Mary on a cross<br>
				</b>
				</p>
				<p><i>

				If you choose to run away with me<br>
				I will tickle you internally<br>
				And I see nothing wrong with that<br>
				</i>
				</p>
				<p><b>

				Nothing wrong with that<br>
				(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)<br>
				Nothing wrong with that<br>
				(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)<br>
				Mary on a, Mary on a cross<br>
				</b>
